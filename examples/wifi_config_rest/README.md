# WiFi Config Rest Example

## Overview

This example introduces how to implement a RESTful API server and HTTP server on ESP32 using our ESP32 framework built on top of the ESP-IDF. While doing so, it also exhibits handling of the common use-case of configuring the ESP32 to connect to the desired WiFi network remotely through a simple HTTP call.
